## [Unreleased]

### Added - Sprint 2: Legal eSignature Workflow and Document Hashing

#### Legal eSignature Backend
- **`IHashService` / `HashService`** - Added deterministic SHA-256 uppercase hex hashing over canonical note state, including persisted note fields, canonicalized content JSON, sorted CPT payloads, and sorted objective metrics, with malformed-JSON fallback behavior for both `JsonException` and `ArgumentException`.
- **`SignatureService` legal signature flow** - Extended the existing signature pipeline to require explicit consent and intent, bind signatures to authenticated PT/PTA users, persist one `Signature` row per legal signing event, and distinguish PTA `PendingCoSign` workflow from final PT signature completion.
- **Tamper verification with legacy fallback** - Added latest-signature verification by recomputing the note hash; when no `Signature` rows exist, falls back to the legacy `ClinicalNotes.SignatureHash` field so pre-upgrade notes remain verifiable.
- **Default attestation text** - Stored the default legal attestation on each persisted signature record without introducing new schema.
- **Audit hooks for signatures** - Added `SIGN` and `VERIFY` audit events with note/user/timestamp metadata only and no PHI-bearing payloads.

#### API and Workflow Updates
- **`POST /api/v1/notes/{noteId}/sign`** - Now requires `{ consentAccepted, intentConfirmed }`, derives the signer role from the authenticated principal, captures IP/user-agent metadata when present, and returns explicit note status plus co-sign requirement.
- **`POST /api/v1/notes/{noteId}/co-sign`** - Kept as the PT-only compatibility alias while requiring the same consent/intent request contract and finalizing PTA daily notes through the shared legal signature flow.
- **`GET /api/v1/notes/{noteId}/verify`** - Added canonical verification endpoint returning `{ isValid, message }` while preserving `GET /verify-signature` as a compatibility alias.
- **Explicit consent/intent on signature** - `SubmitAsync` in `NoteWorkspaceApiService` now accepts `consentAccepted` and `intentConfirmed` as parameters instead of hardcoding `true`, and `NoteWorkspacePage` presents a dedicated consent/intent dialog that requires the clinician to explicitly check both boxes before the API call is made.

#### Changed
- **Objective metric mutability** - Objective metrics are now editable until the note is truly finalized so PTA-signed `PendingCoSign` notes remain modifiable before the final PT signature, matching the deferred immutability scope of the next PR.

#### Verification
- **Compliance test coverage** - Added deterministic hash tests, legal signature service tests, verification/tamper detection tests, endpoint authorization inventory coverage for `GET /api/v1/notes/{noteId:guid}/verify`, workspace submit payload coverage, and end-to-end sign/verify route coverage.
- **Integration auth harness** - Seeded deterministic internal users for the role-based integration auth handler so stricter signer-to-user binding remains active in end-to-end tests.
### Added - Sprint 2: Rules Engine Enforcement

#### Centralized Compliance Validation
- **`ValidationResult` / `ValidatedOperationResponse`** - Added a shared compliance validation envelope with `isValid`, `errors`, `warnings`, and `requiresOverride` for note save and evaluation flows.
- **`INoteSaveValidationService`** - Added a service-layer validation orchestrator that merges Progress Note and 8-minute rule results before persistence.
- **`INoteWriteService` / `NoteWriteService`** - Added a dedicated note write service so `/api/v1/notes` create/update enforcement runs outside controllers/endpoints.

#### Rules Engine Enforcement
- **`IRulesEngine.CheckProgressNoteDueAsync`** - Added Medicare-specific Progress Note due evaluation with warning thresholds at 8 visits / 25 days and hard stops at 10 visits / 30 days.
- **`IRulesEngine.ValidateTimedUnitsAsync`** - Added timed CPT enforcement for missing CPT data, mixed timed/untimed entries, `<5` minute hard stops, `5-7` minute warning+override cases, and overbilled timed-unit warning+override cases.
- **Progress Note reset behavior** - Signed Evaluation and signed Progress Note records now reset PN visit/day counters for server-side enforcement.
- **Shared timed-unit calculation path** - `CalculateCptTime` now uses the same aggregate timed-unit helper as save validation to avoid drift between helper output and enforced billing logic.

#### Note Save and API Behavior
- **Daily note draft saves** - `DailyNoteService.SaveDraftAsync` now validates compliance before `SaveChangesAsync` and returns a typed save envelope instead of a tuple result.
- **Workspace saves** - `NoteWorkspaceV2Service.SaveAsync` now returns a typed validation envelope and surfaces warnings/override flags for timed CPT rule checks.
- **Structured save responses** - Note create/update, daily note saves, and workspace saves now return top-level `isValid`, `errors`, `warnings`, and `requiresOverride`, with `422 Unprocessable Entity` for compliance hard stops.
- **Compliance evaluate endpoints** - `/api/v1/compliance/evaluate/pn-frequency/*` and `/api/v1/compliance/evaluate/8-minute-rule` now return `ValidationResult`.
- **DTO contract updates** - Daily note and workspace CPT models now carry `Units` and `Minutes` so timed-unit enforcement can run server-side from note payloads.

#### Client and Test Coverage
- **Workspace client handling** - The note workspace API client now preserves structured compliance errors, warnings, and override requirements from `422` save responses.
- **Compliance and integration tests** - Updated rules-engine, note-save, workspace, and end-to-end coverage for PN warnings/hard stops, 8-minute rule blocks/warnings, combined validation results, and structured save envelopes.

### Added - Sprint 2: Compliance Schema Foundation

#### Legal eSignature and Compliance Data Model
- **`Signature` entity** - New legal-grade signature table with note/user foreign keys, signer role, timestamp, signature hash, attestation text, consent/intent flags, and optional IP/device metadata.
- **`RuleOverride` entity** - New compliance override table capturing rule name, clinician justification, attestation text, timestamp, and required user relationship.
- **`ComplianceSettings` entity** - New future-facing compliance configuration table with default override attestation text, minimum justification length, and allowed override types payload.

#### Existing Schema Extensions
- **`Addendum`** - Extended with optional `SignatureHash` and explicit `CreatedByUserId -> Users` foreign key while preserving the existing append-only note linkage.
- **`AuditLog`** - Added standalone `EntityId` index support while retaining the existing richer audit structure (`EventType`, `CorrelationId`, `MetadataJson`, severity, success state).

#### EF Core Migrations
- **`ApplicationDbContext`** - Added `DbSet<Signature>`, `DbSet<RuleOverride>`, and `DbSet<ComplianceSettings>` plus explicit relationship, index, and default-value configuration for the new compliance foundation tables.
- **Provider migrations** - Added `AddComplianceSignatureEntities` migrations for SQLite, SQL Server, and Postgres.
- **Postgres migration cleanup** - Normalized `ClinicId` filtered index definitions in the model so the Postgres provider migration no longer includes unrelated index-filter churn.

#### Verification
- **Schema smoke coverage** - Updated `DatabaseProviderMigrationTests` to query `Signatures`, `RuleOverrides`, and `ComplianceSettings`.
- **SQLite migration apply** - Applied the new SQLite migration locally and verified `dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes` returns clean.

### Added - Option C: CHANGELOG Enforcement Gate

#### CI Workflow: `changelog-required.yml`
- **`changelog-required.yml`** — New PR gate that fails if `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is not modified in the pull request. Passes when the `no-changelog` label is present (explicit bypass). Runs on `pull_request` events (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review, labeled, unlabeled) with minimal `pull-requests: read` permissions.

#### CI Workflow: `update-docs-on-merge.yml` (disabled push)
- **Removed `git push origin main` step** from the "Update CHANGELOG and Documentation" workflow. The step was causing `GH013` failures because repository rules require changes through a pull request. The step is replaced by a notice. CHANGELOG entries must now be included in the PR itself (see above gate).

### Added - Sprint K: Audit Closure and Release Blocker Triage

#### Secret Management Policy (CI Enforcement)
- **`ci-secret-policy.yml`** — New CI workflow that blocks PRs when tracked config files contain real (non-placeholder) signing keys. Runs on every pull request against `main`.
- **`[Category=SecretPolicy]` test trait** — Added `Trait("Category", "SecretPolicy")` to `ConfigurationValidationTests` tests that assert tracked config files contain only approved placeholder values. Enables targeted filtering in the new secret policy CI gate.

#### Governance Documentation
- **`docs/REMEDIATION_BASELINE.md`** — Sprint K remediation baseline: resolves the secret management policy contradiction (placeholders allowed; real secrets forbidden), confirms background service existence and wiring, documents CI governance baseline, and assigns all Sprint A–J gaps to remediation sprints O–T.
- **`docs/ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE_MAP.md`** — Sprint A–J acceptance evidence map: maps every acceptance criterion to its automated test, CI gate, or documented manual verification step. Identifies 6 open gaps assigned to Sprints O–T.

#### CI.md Update
- **Secret Policy CI (Sprint K)** section added to `docs/CI.md` documenting the new `ci-secret-policy.yml` workflow, failure conditions, approved placeholder values, and local reproduction commands.

### Added - Phase 8: Platform Integration & Completion

#### SQLCipher End-to-End Encryption
- **Database.Encryption.Enabled** - Toggleable encryption via appsettings (default: false)
- **Connection pre-open flow** - PRAGMA key set before EF uses connection (prevents silent encryption failure)

- **SyncIntegrationTests** - 5 tests for encrypted DB queue persistence

#### Design Documentation
- **docs/PHASE_8_DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS.md** - Pre-implementation guardrails and technical design
- **6 Guardrails documented:**
  1. Encryption must be toggleable
  2. Connection must be pre-opened before EF
  3. MAUI SecureStorage must fail-closed
  4. QuestPDF renderer implemented with DbContext injection for data loading
  5. Integration tests (5 categories)
  6. Platform validation (CI-automatable)

### Fixed

- **iOS CI Build** - Switched MAUI iOS CI target from `iossimulator-arm64` to `ios-arm64` to resolve `actool` simulator runtime errors on `macos-15` + Xcode 16.2 runners.

### Security

- **Fail-closed encryption** - Invalid/missing keys throw at startup (no silent failures)
- **MAUI SecureStorage** - Platform-native secure key storage (no dev key fallback in production)
- **NO PHI in logs** - Integration tests validate telemetry contains only entity IDs
